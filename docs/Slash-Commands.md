# Slash commands

Recognized commands stay blue in the composer and work at the start, middle, or
end of a message. `/search` applies only to the current message and stays visible
until acceptance. Deleting it cancels explicit search; subsequent messages follow
the automatic-search preference. Both composer layouts show automatic search’s
On state and an Off action when active. Capture commands run when you submit.
`/think` applies only to the current answer, including File Mode requests.

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/search` | Search the web for this message only |
| `/screen` | Capture all displays |
| `/snapshot` | Select a screen region |
| `/think` | Request more careful reasoning |

Type `/` anywhere after whitespace to see commands, icons, and descriptions.
Suggestions filter by the text before the caret, case-insensitively. Use ↑/↓ to
select, Tab or Return to complete, or click a suggestion. Escape dismisses the
list before hiding the panel. Shift-Return inserts a newline. Completion edits
only the command at the caret and supports Undo.

The menu floats above the latest Enigma composer without moving its attachment,
model, or send controls. Search uses blue, Screen purple, Snapshot orange, and
Think pink; each menu icon and its command label share the same color. Draft
commands retain their blue highlighting. Compact and wide layouts use the
app’s existing text sizes, and history remains hidden at startup.

Commands must be separate tokens; punctuation may follow them. Quoted examples,
backtick code, URLs, paths, and unknown commands remain literal text. Repeated
commands activate once; `/snapshot` takes precedence over `/screen` if both occur.
Screen and Search remain incompatible with attached File Mode selections.

The screenshot above is intentionally checked in as UI review documentation.
Build products and generated test renders remain outside the repository. The
rendering test also retains the screenshot as an XCTest attachment.

Verification uses `scripts/verify-xcode.sh build`, `test`, and `analyze`.
Regression coverage includes placement, boundaries, Unicode caret offsets,
completion, undo, keyboard navigation, multiline entry, capture cancellation,
focus restoration, and conversation scrolling.
